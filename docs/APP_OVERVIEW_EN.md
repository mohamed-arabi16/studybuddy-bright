## 📚 Comprehensive Feature Walkthrough

### 1. Smart Course Management
Start by creating a digital twin of your academic semester.
-   **Syllabus Extraction:** Upload your course syllabus (PDF, Image, or Scanned Doc). Our integrated OCR and AI engine reads the file and extracts a structured list of topics, estimating the difficulty and time required for each.
-   **Manual Control:** You always have the final say. Add, edit, or reorder topics manually if the AI misses something.
-   **Department & University Tracking:** Keep your courses organized by semester and subject.

### 2. Intelligent Study Planning
The core engine of StudyBuddy is its "Smart Plan" generator.
-   **Exam-Centric Scheduling:** The algorithm prioritizes courses with upcoming exams, ensuring you finish all material *before* the test date.
-   **Personalized Parameters:** Set your "Daily Study Hours" and "Days Off" (e.g., "I don't study on Fridays"). The plan respects your boundaries to prevent burnout.
-   **Prerequisite Handling:** The AI understands that you must learn "Algebra" before "Calculus." It schedules topics in the logical learning order (Topological Sort).
-   **Dynamic Rescheduling:** Missed a day? No problem. One click re-optimizes your entire schedule to get you back on track without the guilt.
-   **Calendar Sync:** Seamlessly sync your study sessions to your **Google Calendar**, blocking out time so you actually do the work.

### 3. AI-Powered Learning Tools
Go beyond planning with tools that actively help you learn.
-   **Past Exam Analysis:** Upload a PDF of a previous year's exam. The AI analyzes every question, maps it back to your course topics, and generates a **"Yield Report."** This report highlights which topics appear most frequently, helping you prioritize high-value content.
-   **AI Quiz Generation:** Select any topic (e.g., "Thermodynamics") and ask the AI to generate a practice quiz. Get immediate feedback on your answers to test your retention.
-   **Topic Deep Dives:** Stuck on a concept? Use the "Analyze Topic" feature to get an AI-generated summary, key concepts, and study resources for that specific item.

### 4. Advanced Grade Calculator
Stop guessing what you need to score on the final.
-   **"What-If" Scenarios:** Input your current grades and target final grade (e.g., "I want an A"). The calculator tells you exactly what you need to score on the remaining exams.
-   **Complex Grading Rules:** Supports weighted averages, "Drop Lowest Quiz," and "Best 3 of 4 Exams" logic.
-   **Curve Simulation:** Apply potential curves (e.g., "Add 5 points to everyone") to see how it affects your standing.

### 5. Progress Tracking
-   **Dashboard:** See your daily tasks, upcoming exams, and overall progress at a glance.
-   **Completion Tracking:** Mark topics as "Done" to see your completion percentage rise.
-   **Focus Mode:** A distraction-free view for your daily study session.
